#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Refer to the process of designing, developing and maintaining software so as to deliver a high quality software on time and budget for addressing a certain on going challenges.
Importance of software engineering are
1. help to increase the connectivity level in different aspects, a well designed software may intergrate various soource of informations and skills as well as knowldges from different sources such as AI platforms, various data bases as well as from professional and experienced peoples, also it may intergrate various field of focus or various sides such as between receivers and providers, example agricultural software ware application may provide easy interation and connecivity between farmers, extension officers and agricultural experts such as researches hence ensuring easier flow of communication among them.
2. Reduces costs, a well designed and developed software it results to perform many tasks and outcompetes even those tasks that requires a lot of labours to perform since all of the issues can carried on an application, also it may reduce frequently repair up and maintainance of an application.
3. it help to increase the production efficiency and cost and time effective, a well desgned and developed application may result to quick carryout of an activity as a short time and bring high output due to the fact that it can be reached by many people in the world at the same time and get utilized at once, a thing that is beyond the human ability or a poorly developed application, hence bringing many output at once.
4. it help to increase the scalability of an application, a well designed and developed application should aim to grow with the increase of users hence allowing an application to hold many customers as possible without getting futique there fore making a best place for a users and increasing production.
5. Through software engineering help to speed up the growth of innovation and advantage competitiveness, this then results to the creation of high quality and usebility applications. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are
1. The birth of software engineering at 1968. this was introduced during the NATO software Engineering conference at 1968 so as to solve the software crisis that was raised due to poor software development practices and cost overruns as well as unreliable software so as to have the engineering principles on software development, disciplined development process and have a structured programming.
2. The rise of object-Oriented programming between 1980 to 1990, this was based on the evolution of software engineering by introduction of various concepts like encapsulation and increases in popularity of programming languages like python.
3. The Agile and DevOps revolutions fro 2000 to present. this is based on the prioritizing iterative development, customer collaboration and flexibility and intregrating development with operations so as to simplify software development as well as enhencing automation and improve collaboration hence making software faster and more reliable.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of Software Development Life cycle are
1. planning, This refer to the phase were the software developer engaged in identifying software development objectives, key stakeholders, resources and the whole feasibility of the project.
2. Requirement Analysis, this is the phase were the developer gather and analyze the user requirement to understand what software should perform
3. Design,This involve creating a system architecture and design specifications based on the user requirement such as defining system component and data base design.
4. Implementation, This involve coding the programme according to the design document created during requirement analysis stage in which the programming language and project framework are chosen according to user requirement.
5. Testing, this involve trying to run and use an application for selected users as a sample so as to identify a defects and buds hence maintaining functionality, security and performance, this may include unity testing, intergration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.
6. Deployment, this involves releasing an application to the users, which it can be fully release or partial release according to developer reasons.
7. Maintainance and support, this involve a developer to monitor an application, evaluating and assessing its performance as well as performing regular maintainance according to needs and defects.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison between Waterfall and Agile methodologies are
1. both it need design and implementation documentation
2. both it involve customer involvement
3. both it involve to be tested
4. both it undergo risks and have risk management
5. both have a development life cycle phases
   Contrast between Waterfall and Agile methodologies are
   1. Waterfall methodology it uses linear and sequential approach, while Agile it uses iterative and incremental approach
   2. Water methodology it is rigid in nature in which changes are difficult to implement once the development starts, while Agile methodology is highly flexible in nature in which it allow changes at any stage of development even at late stage.
   3. In Waterfall phases are in sequential in which each phase should be completed before moving to the next phase, while in Agile phases are in interuptive in which no need to complent the whole phase before jumping to another.
   4. Waterfall methodology involves extensive documentation before project start, while Agile methodology involves minimal documentation before project start.
   5. Waterfall mainly involves customers at the beginning and end of the project, while Agile methodology involves customers throughout the project.
   6. Under Waterfall methodology, testing is done at the end of the development cycle, while in an Agile methodology, testing is done throughout the development cycle.
   7. Waterfall methodology faces high risks since it is tested at the end ofthe development, while Agile methodology faces low risks since it is tested throughout the development.
       Example of snerios where Waterfall can be applied
      1. on a project with minimum expected changes such as construction of software where the specification are known and unlikely to change.
      2. where the regulated industries requiring strict documentation such as development of food preparation software that meet TFDA regulation
      3. on a large scale  project with well defined requirement

         Examples of snarios where Agile can be applied
         1. on software with a focus on user experience and frequent updates
         2.  on project with evolving requirements such as developing new mobile application based on user feedback


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles and responsiblities of
            Software developer
  responsible for designing, coding, developing and maintaining software application.
            Quality assurance Engineer
  responsible for ensuring that the software meets quality standards by identifying bugs, verifying functionality and preventing defects bt performing manual and automated tests and other issues
            Project Manager
responsible for overseing the entire software development process, ensuring completion of a project on time and within budgets and meet requirements


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Imprtance of Intergrated Development Environments are
1. improve code efficiency, due to having tools like code editor and providing feedback responses such as syntax errors, and auto-completion detecting it makes easy to identify the mistakes and improve the code quality.
2. it provide debugging that allows the developer to test and fix issues or mistakes
3. provide easy acessibility and intergrity with other tools such as databases, cloud services which then provide easy conduction of work.
4. help to manage large code bases due to having features like code folding, searching and project organization
   example of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, Sublime text, Pycharm etc.

   Importance of Version Control System are
   1. it ensure security and backups to codes, since is stored on a repostories.
   2. help the developers to work on a separate features and merge them into the main project when ready.
   3. increases collaboration, since it enable the multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without problem or conflict
   4. it allow the developer to track code changes, who made them and why
   5. it can provide easy code recovery.
      example of of VCS are, Git, SVN, Mercurial


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by software engineers and strategies to overcome it are
1. Difficult or failer in managing complex or large code bases such as to navigate, maintain and debug.
this can be addressed through using modular programming and clean code principles,implementing proper documentation and code comments as well as utilizing Intergrated Development Environments.
2.Difficult in debugging and fixing Bugs
This can addressed through using a debugging tools and logging framework to track error efficiently, implementing unit and automated testing to catch bugs also by following bug tracking system such as JIRA.
3. Difficult in Keeping up with a rapidly changing technology
   this can addressed by continuosly learning online courses, blogs and technology conference, joining developer communities such as Github,Stack Overflow
4. Security and data privacy Risks
   can be addressed by following secure coding practices and conducting regular security audits and penetration testings as well as keeping software update and use of authentication mechanism
5.Difficult in meeting project dead lines
 this can be addressed through the use of Agile methodology to break project into manageable sprints


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit testing, this involve testing the functionability or accuracy of an individual component of an application. this help to detect the early stage bugs
   Intergration testing, this ivolves testing the intergrated services so as to verify its interation. this help to ensure all component works together.
   System testing,this ivolve testing the whole system of a software so as to validate end to end functionality. This help to ensure entire software works as expected.
   Acceptance testing, this is conducted by the end-user to verify the software meet their business needs. this help to ensure that software is ready for production.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering, Refer to the art of crafting questions or statements so as to get the best responses from AI modules in order to get clear and accurate responses from AI.
Importance of prompt engineering are
1. it enhence quality and accuracy AI responses.
2. it enables customization and control, by refining AI outputs by specifying tone, format and depth of response
3. It reduces bias and misinterpretation


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "What are the features of an elephant", improved prompt " What are the Behaviral unique features of an elephant". this is improved because it will only provide an output for unique behaviours of an elephant compared to vague prompt which will enclude even morphological features as well as shared feature of elephant hence providing misleading answers.
